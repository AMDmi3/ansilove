- Removing hardcoded paths in 'CMakeLists.txt' for GD library detection
- Add additional include directories for compat functions to avoid

- Moving ANSI and PCBoard character structures to their respective
  loader headers

- Removing optional filters for PCBoard sequences
- Pruning now unused 'str_replace' function
